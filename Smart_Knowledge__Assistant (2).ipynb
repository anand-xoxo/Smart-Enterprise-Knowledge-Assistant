            "\n",
            "1. **Casual Leave (CL):**\n",
            "   - Entitlement: 8 days per year.\n",
            "   - Restrictions: No more than 5 days at a time, and cannot be combined with other leaves except special casual leave.\n",
            "   - Carry Forward: Unused leave lapses at the year's end.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Earned Leave (EL):**\n",
            "   - Entitlement: 30 days per year, credited as 15 days on January 1 and July 1.\n",
            "   - Restrictions: Up to 180 days can be availed at a time.\n",
            "   - Accumulation: Up to 300 days.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Half Pay Leave (HPL):**\n",
            "   - Credited at 10 days biannually.\n",
            "   - Usage: Can be availed for medical reasons.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Maternity Leave:**\n",
            "   - Entitlement: 180 days for pregnancy (if less than two children), 45 days for miscarriage.\n",
            "   - Conditions: Not debited to the leave account, full pay is provided.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Paternity Leave:**\n",
            "   - Entitlement: 15 days for males during wife's confinement, if less than two children.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Adoption Leave:**\n",
            "   - Entitlement: 180 days for female employees adopting a child under one year old.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Extraordinary Leave (EOL):**\n",

            "\n",
            "Leaves are subject to availability, approval, and not claiming as a matter of right. Various leaves can be combined with others, except with casual leave, and are also governed by Central Government employee leave rules.\n",

            "A2: Certainly! Here's a simplified version of the leave policy:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Casual Leave (CL):**\n",
            "   - You get 8 days per year.\n",
            "   - You can't take more than 5 days in a row.\n",
            "   - Not carried over to the next year.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Earned Leave (EL):**\n",

            "   - You can save up to 300 days.\n",
            "   - You can use up to 180 days at once.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Half Pay Leave (HPL):**\n",
            "   - You earn 10 days every half-year.\n",
            "   - Mainly for medical reasons and is half of your pay.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Maternity Leave:**\n",
            "   - 180 days for having a baby (if less than two kids).\n",
            "   - 45 days for miscarriage.\n",
            "   - You still get paid during this time.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Paternity Leave:**\n",
            "   - 15 days for new fathers around the time of birth.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Adoption Leave:**\n",
            "   - 180 days if you adopt a child under one year old (for mothers).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Extraordinary Leave (EOL):**\n",
            "   - If you run out of other leave, you can ask for this, but it's unpaid and might affect your job if not discussed properly.\n",
            "\n",
            "These leaves allow you to take time off for various reasons while being mindful that some are limited and need to be used wisely.\n",

            "A3: Here's a simple breakdown of the maternity leave policy:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Duration:** Eligible for 180 days if you are having a baby and have fewer than two surviving children.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Pay:** You receive full pay during this leave.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Leave Account:** Maternity leave is not deducted from your leave balance.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Additional Days:** If you have a miscarriage or abortion, you get a total of 45 days throughout your service, regardless of how many kids you have.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Combination:** You can combine maternity leave with other types of leave if needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Increments and Pension:** Time on maternity leave counts towards your service, meaning your increments and pension are unaffected.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Documentation:** After the leave, you'll need to submit hospital discharge papers and the child's birth certificate.\n",
